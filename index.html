            <p>For the ‘Continue?’ jam, I worked with a team of two to create a game in 48 hours. As a programmer, I was unfamiliar with the engine (Godot 3.6) at the time, forcing me to learn from the other programmer as I worked. This was also my first jam and I wasn’t really used to short-form game development. Many learned techniques from other engines no longer applied in the same way, so being able to research efficiently was crucial. I programmed the game’s interactables, including the enemies and powerups, which required coordination with the other programmer to establish interaction between them. Having to learn Godot’s signal system under a time constraint was difficult, but the experience helped me in future jams significantly. After the jam concluded, our game was posted on itch.io and reviewed by game review streams, as well as being used as data for the jam’s organizer.</p>
