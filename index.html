            <p>For the ‘Continue?’ jam, I worked with a team of two to create a game in 48 hours. As a programmer, I was unfamiliar with the engine (Godot 3.6) at the time, forcing me to learn from the other programmer as I worked. This was also my first jam and I wasn’t really used to short-form game development. Many learned techniques from other engines no longer applied in the same way, so being able to research efficiently was crucial. I programmed the game’s interactables, including the enemies and powerups, which required coordination with the other programmer to establish interaction between them. Having to learn Godot’s signal system under a time constraint was difficult, but the experience helped me in future jams significantly. After the jam concluded, our game was posted on itch.io and reviewed by game review streams, as well as being used as data for the jam’s organizer.</p>

            <p>I analyzed a codebase of various developers that I no longer had contact with in order to improve and update as per my client’s instructions. I provided monthly presentations on the quality of my progress. The client required timely deliveries for the requested content. Additionally, the client provided plentiful feedback that I was able to incorporate in the future. Furthermore, I was required to work exclusively with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was simultaneously tasked with working on miniature games to include in the main game, which was in Godot 4.2. This meant communicating with a large team consisting of artists and programmers. I worked almost exclusively in code, often creating a majority of the backend before other intermediary team members would implement the assets. Both of these games were showed off at Indy Pop Con, and generated traffic for Crane Naval Base.</p>

            <p>Alongside another programmer and two artists, I programmed a multiplayer party game in 72 hours for the Global Game Jam 2024. As I was proficient with the engine at the time (Godot 4.2), the main challenge was creating a concept that fit the jam’s odd theme. We went through a lot of iterations of our idea and had to do plenty of brainstorming as we worked. Additionally, the multiplayer aspect was a mechanic none of us had ever dived into before. This meant a lot of research on the programming side. GitHub was also a valuable tool when working in a tight schedule, as sharing assets and code between machines was integral. In the end, we presented the game at our GGJ Jam Space to our fellow jammers, talking extensively about our design process and challenges we faced. Our team gave and received feedback on the games presented at the jam.</p>

            <p>For this project, I programmed in C# in Unity to create a finished game in six weeks. My team consisted of two 3D artists and two programmers. We held weekly meetings to collaborate and set goals to complete by our next meeting. The largest challenge we were forced to overcome was the alternate controller, which consisted of a record that was spun in order to interact with the game. Therefore, we were essentially limited to only two inputs and had to base our ideas and programming around it. The game saw plenty of different iterations, but generally improved steadily each week. Our game was presented at the Music and Gaming Festival (MAGFest) in a collection with other alternate control games. We appeared as a team in order to represent our game at the festival.</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! I am Zach Dicken, a gameplay programmer and game designer. I am currently a student at the Luddy School of Informatics Computing & Engineering Indianapolis. I've participated in multiple game jams and enjoy working on creative projects, alone or in a team. I'm always looking for an opportunity to expand my skillset or lend a hand to someone less familiar with certain software or engines.
                From a young age, I've been interested in video games, which over time morphed into wanting to understand those games. Over the last couple of years, I have finally been able to dive deep into game development, from opening GameMaker for the first time to working with Crane Naval Base on an educational game for new hires. I'm always open to work and more than happy to start a conversation about games, what makes them work, or what's making them not.</p>
