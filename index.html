            <p>For the ‘Continue?’ jam, I worked with a team of two to create a game in 48 hours. As a programmer, I was unfamiliar with the engine (Godot 3.6) at the time, forcing me to learn from the other programmer as I worked. This was also my first jam and I wasn’t really used to short-form game development. Many learned techniques from other engines no longer applied in the same way, so being able to research efficiently was crucial. I programmed the game’s interactables, including the enemies and powerups, which required coordination with the other programmer to establish interaction between them. Having to learn Godot’s signal system under a time constraint was difficult, but the experience helped me in future jams significantly. After the jam concluded, our game was posted on itch.io and reviewed by game review streams, as well as being used as data for the jam’s organizer.</p>

            <p>I analyzed a codebase of various developers that I no longer had contact with in order to improve and update as per my client’s instructions. I provided monthly presentations on the quality of my progress. The client required timely deliveries for the requested content. Additionally, the client provided plentiful feedback that I was able to incorporate in the future. Furthermore, I was required to work exclusively with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was simultaneously tasked with working on miniature games to include in the main game, which was in Godot 4.2. This meant communicating with a large team consisting of artists and programmers. I worked almost exclusively in code, often creating a majority of the backend before other intermediary team members would implement the assets. Both of these games were showed off at Indy Pop Con, and generated traffic for Crane Naval Base.</p>

            <p>Alongside another programmer and two artists, I programmed a multiplayer party game in 72 hours for the Global Game Jam 2024. As I was proficient with the engine at the time (Godot 4.2), the main challenge was creating a concept that fit the jam’s odd theme. We went through a lot of iterations of our idea and had to do plenty of brainstorming as we worked. Additionally, the multiplayer aspect was a mechanic none of us had ever dived into before. This meant a lot of research on the programming side. GitHub was also a valuable tool when working in a tight schedule, as sharing assets and code between machines was integral. In the end, we presented the game at our GGJ Jam Space to our fellow jammers, talking extensively about our design process and challenges we faced. Our team gave and received feedback on the games presented at the jam.</p>
